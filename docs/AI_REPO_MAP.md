## Project summary

Equatoria Idle is a Vite + TypeScript mobile-first web game with Electron desktop support. It combines:

- an idle/equation progression layer with motes, tiers, looms, forge behavior, achievements, and save/load;
- a visual particle simulation around the equation forge and loom fields;
- an RPG combat mode with zones, enemies, weapons, crafted weapons, terrain, field-space scaling, and visual effects;
- DOM-based menus, tabs, settings, and upgrade panels over low-resolution canvas rendering.

## Main source regions

### `src/app/`

Application orchestration. Read for bootstrap, resize wiring, action dispatch, game-loop integration, active-tab switching, UI refresh, and bridges between sim/render/UI.

Key files:

- `game-app.ts`: starts one owned app instance, wires DOM/panels/resources, and returns its `AppRuntime`.
- `app-runtime.ts`: app-local reverse-order cleanup owner; root DOM is removed last.
- `app-lifecycle.ts`: owns visibility/focus/resize listeners and the skill-point unread poller.
- `app-actions.ts`: central `handleAction()` dispatcher and tab switching.
- `app-game-loop.ts`: owned frame controller plus cross-system update/render order.
- `game-app-canvas-input.ts`: removable pointer input wiring for tap, drag, hover, forge/equation actions.
- `game-app-idle.ts`: offline/idle reward eligibility and queueing helper.

Risks:

- Do not bury progression logic inside UI or DOM handlers.
- Tab switches often need both DOM panel refresh and canvas/render lifecycle updates.
- Resize behavior differs between idle canvas and RPG canvas.
- New app-scoped resources must register cleanup immediately after creation; cleanup must remain idempotent and avoid clearing a replacement runtime's registration.

### `src/sim/`

Authoritative gameplay state and deterministic rules.

Important subareas:

- `game-state.ts`: aggregate state, tap actions, forge sacrifice, loom capture, dev bypasses, tick integration.
- `equation/`: equation state, tap gains, and output evaluation. Display-only equation views are retired to `src/render/legacy/`.
- `resources/`: mote totals, lifetime totals, equivalence score, base-100 size count encode/decode.
- `progression/`: upgrade levels, costs, auto-tap, global multiplier.
- `forge/`: forge crunch/warm-up state, heat taps, timers, crunch lifecycle.
- `looms/`: loom state, passive production, capture conversion, efficiency upgrades.
- `particles/`: sim-facing particle/generator state helpers.
- `rpg/`: persistent RPG progression, equipped weapons, upgrades, crafted weapons, XP/levels.

Risks:

- `sim/` should not depend on DOM, canvas, CSS, audio, or render-only state.
- Save/load versioning must be explicit when persistent shapes change.
- Large-number behavior still relies on JavaScript numbers in many places; avoid accidental overflow-prone comparisons without checking current helpers.

### `src/data/`

Static definitions, constants, tuning, tier metadata, upgrade catalogs, and data-driven behavior.

Important subareas:

- `tiers/`: canonical tier definitions and ordering.
- `equation/`: tier-to-equation-role mapping.
- `looms/`: loom definitions and cost/rate helpers.
- `particles/`: particle physics config, Particle Life matrix, size-tier helpers, mutable dev tweaks.
- `upgrades/`: equation/idle upgrade catalog and formulas.
- `balance/`: global idle balance constants.
- `rpg/`: RPG weapon definitions, upgrade definitions, crafted weapon logic, weapon resolvers.

Risks:

- Do not scatter tier colors, ids, or ordering across unrelated files.
- Crafted weapons depend on tier weight/composition math; avoid hardcoded per-tier assumptions outside the canonical helpers.
- Lens/weave combat bonuses aggregate through `src/data/rpg/equipment-modifiers.ts`; attack files should consume the combined helper result instead of raw inventory/equipment state.
- Lens/weave acquisition rolls live in `src/data/rpg/equipment-rewards.ts`; keep drop rates and zone eligibility centralized there.
- Boss MIDI patterns live in `src/data/rpg/boss-midi-config.ts` and runtime `.mid` files live under `ASSETS/bossMidi/`; parsing is cached and boss-only.
- Boss roster names, visibility, and tempo lookup are centralized in `src/data/rpg/boss-metadata.ts` and `boss-tempo-config.ts`; use those helpers rather than hardcoded secret IDs.

### `src/render/canvas/`

Canvas creation, resize, render-state reset, and idle viewport debug.

Key concepts:

- Idle/equation view uses a 320 × 640 logical coordinate space.
- Pixelated idle canvas mode uses a low backing resolution and CSS upscaling.
- Crisp mode uses CSS × DPR backing.
- DOM HUD overlays must map to the same logical coordinate assumptions.

Risks:

- Avoid mixing CSS pixels, backing pixels, and logical pixels.
- Always reset canvas state after effects that use transforms, global alpha, filters, or blend modes.

### `src/render/particles/`

Visual particle system for the idle/equation mode. It owns transient particles, particle pooling, Particle Life forces, forge/loom field forces, merges, shockwaves, trails, glow fields, and debug overlays.

High-value files:

- `particle-system.ts`: orchestrator and owner of particle arrays, pool, matrix, callbacks, debug state.
- `particle-types.ts`: particle interfaces and effect types.
- `particle-pool.ts`: allocation control.
- `particle-physics.ts`: normal mote drift, pointer movement, velocity limits, walls, and trails; intentionally no loom/forge attraction.
- `particle-life.ts`: pairwise Particle Life force calculation.
- `particle-merge.ts`: generator and procedural merge logic.
- `particle-forge.ts`: crunch completion and particle-to-mass conversion.
- `forge-field-forces.ts`: capture-only forge and loom field checks; does not attract or steer motes.
- `legacy/loom-forge-attraction-legacy.ts`: non-runtime history of the removed loom/forge attraction and containment implementation.
- `particle-renderer.ts`: batched draw pipeline.
- `particle-glow-field.ts`: high-graphics nebula-style glow field.

Risks:

- Hot path. Avoid object allocation, array recreation, and callback-heavy designs in per-frame loops.
- 1×1 motes are intentionally inert in Particle Life.
- Non-alivened particles should not participate in Particle Life forces.
- Visual particles are not the sole authority for economy.

### `src/render/forge/`

Equation Forge rendering and ring visuals.

Key files:

- `forge-renderer.ts`: public forge draw API, crunch visuals, loom auras, sacrifice flash.
- `forge-renderer-draw.ts`: private helper implementation.
- `forge-ring-renderer.ts`: five decorative ring sprites, active ring count, spin multipliers.

Risks:

- Forge state belongs to `sim/forge`; render reads state and visual time only.
- Visual ring changes should not affect crunch/crafting economy.

### `src/render/background/`

Decorative and zone-specific background effects.

Important effects:

- `background-animation.ts`: menu/idle frame-sequence background.
- `vermiculate-effect.ts`: worm-line decorative effect.
- `substrate-effect.ts`: crystalline crack effect.
- `nadir-substrate-effect.ts`: Nadir variant.
- `true-binary-horizon.ts`: preserved original True subzone Binary Horizon.
- `true-surface-elite.ts`: True-subzone parametric surface elites plus the dense, long-trail Bohemian Dome super elite.
- `true-galaxy-enemy.ts`: True-subzone normal Galaxy particle-cloud enemy, projectile streams, and wave-scoped doubling damage chain.
- `horizon-projectile-glow.ts`: cached radial glow sprites shared by Pentagon and Galaxy projectiles.
- `zenith-binary-horizon.ts`: Zenith wave/cut/collapse Binary Horizon lifecycle.
- `zenith-binary-ring-background.ts`: elite Binary Ring background.
- `nadir-cubic-grid-background.ts`: CubicGrid-style rotating lattice, exposes projection state for gameplay anchoring.

Risks:

- Many effects rely on offscreen canvases or typed arrays for performance.
- Internal helper modules marked as internals should generally be imported only by their owning effect.
- Nadir cube-point gameplay must share projection math with the background, not approximate separately.

### `src/render/rpg/`

Large RPG combat/render subsystem. Use `file_index.md` for exact file-level details before editing.

Major clusters:

- constants and types: `rpg-constants.ts`, `rpg-weapon-constants.ts`, `rpg-enemy-constants.ts`, `rpg-types.ts`, `rpg-enemy-types.ts`, `rpg-entity-types.ts`.
- encounter ownership: `rpg-encounter-collections.ts` is the canonical per-renderer array inventory,
  factory, boss/zone/restart profile source, and typed Verdure-resize/overlay-fade body-profile
  source; do not add parallel lifecycle or semantic membership lists.
- attack readiness: `rpg-player-attack-readiness.ts` owns the exact participating/excluded
  collection policy; `RpgPlayerAttackCtx` and `RpgWeaponCtx` inherit the canonical collection
  contract and retain its owner plus direct aliases.
- factories: `rpg-factories.ts`, `rpg-factories-early.ts`, `rpg-factories-mid.ts`, `rpg-factories-late.ts`.
- enemies: enemy update/draw modules, elite update/draw modules, Aliven modules.
- player/weapons: player attack, projectiles, chain whip, sword, lasers, poison, missiles, mines, companion ships.
- combat feedback: death particles, hit effects, damage numbers, shot lines.
- fluid/field: `rpg-fluid*` and field-space modules.
- zones/terrain: zone-specific backgrounds, cave walls, Caustics topology/fish pathing, Verdure walls/plants, Horizon subzones.
- UI: RPG menu, weapons tab, upgrades/stats panels.

Risks:

- Canonical encounter arrays must retain identity. Mutate contents in place and keep specialized
  cleanup with its owner when it does more than truncation.

- RPG code is broad. Do not read all of it for every task; choose a cluster first.
- Keep weapon resolver support for crafted weapons. Static catalog lookups are not enough when equipped ids may be crafted.
- Low-graphics mode should reduce visual load without changing combat state.
- Field-space changes must preserve stable safe-core readability while expanded active bounds reveal real gameplay space rather than zooming.

### `src/ui/`

DOM panels, tabs, settings, upgrade views, resources, achievements, RPG menu and weapon crafting UI.

Risks:

- UI should dispatch typed actions rather than directly mutating arbitrary game state.
- Important actions must remain mobile-tappable and not hover-only.
- If adding settings, update defaults, persistence, and UI display together.

### `src/styles/`

CSS is split by base/canvas/panels/tabs/components/responsive/idle overlay. Read `src/styles/canvas.css` for idle and RPG canvas/container sizing.

Risks:

- Canvas CSS can change gameplay perception through scaling, not just presentation.
- RPG canvas host expansion is intentionally live world area, not zoom-in behavior.

### `src/settings/`

Settings state and save/load. Read before adding persisted settings, save fields, migration behavior, or reset semantics.

Risks:

- Browser and Electron saves use different localStorage profiles.
- Save migrations must default old data safely.
- Do not silently destroy user progression.

### `electron/`, scripts, and public assets

- `electron/main.cjs`: hardened desktop launcher, custom `equatoria://app/` protocol, CSP behavior, separate profile/cache.
- `scripts/copy-assets.mjs`: copies runtime asset directories into `dist/ASSETS` after builds.
- Batch scripts provide Windows-friendly launch/build workflows.
- `public/assets/` and `ASSETS/` contain sprites, animations, sounds, icons, and runtime media.

Risks:

- Asset path changes can break GitHub Pages, Electron, or desktop mode differently.
- Avoid relying on external network fonts/assets for store readiness.

## Current high-value architecture invariants

1. Idle/equation canvas logical space is 320 × 640.
2. RPG safe core is 360 × 640, with expanded active/visible bounds for larger hosts.
3. Simulation state is authoritative; render state is transient unless explicitly persisted.
4. Tier identity and order must remain canonical and data-driven.
5. Crafted weapon ids must resolve through the dynamic resolver, not only static maps.
6. Particle, RPG, background, and fluid hot paths should avoid per-frame allocation.
7. Mobile-first usability and desktop support must both remain valid.
8. Build #206 is the latest verified build note when this file was created.

## When this map is stale

Update this file when:

- a new subsystem or major file is added;
- files are split, merged, or moved;
- validation commands change;
- a major architectural invariant changes;
- new agent workflow rules are added.
